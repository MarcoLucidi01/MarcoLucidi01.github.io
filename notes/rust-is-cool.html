<title>rust is cool</title>

<h1>rust is cool</h1>
<p>started learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> recently for a
side project. I'm at chapter 8 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Book</a>.
I'm really a newbie and I have a lot to grasp yet, but the experience so far as
been positive!

<p>some random points about rust:

<ul>
<li>everything is immutable by default
<li>OOP is supported but NOT IMPOSED <del>(fuck you java)</del>
<li>there are no wrapper for generics <del>(fuck you java)</del>
<li>there are no exceptions <del>(fuck you java)</del>
<li>there is the <code>match</code> keyword which is awesome. It's similar to a
<code>switch</code> but it's much much more powerful. It's a <code>switch</code>
on steroids! <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/match.html">Look</a>!
<li>there is no <code>NULL</code>! The concept of <code>NULL</code> is expressed
with the enum variant <code>Option::None</code>. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html"><code>Option</code></a>
enum can hold either <code>Some(T)</code> value or <code>None</code>. It's like
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html"><code>Optional</code></a>
in java, but more convenient to use thanks to <code>match</code>.
<li>the compiler is a bit slow, but gives you excellent error messages!
<li>this whole idea of RAII, default immutability and memory checks at compile
time seems a really gooood one! It lets rust to run blazingly fast (like C),
to not have a GC nor a runtime and to provide good abstractions at near to 0 cost!
</ul>
