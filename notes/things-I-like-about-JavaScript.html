<h1>things I like about JavaScript</h1>

<h2>functions</h2>
<p>Functions in JavaScript can be stored in variables, objects and arrays.
Functions can be passed as arguments to functions, and functions can be returned
from functions.

<p>They can be defined inside other functions and get access to parameters and
variables of the functions they are defined within. This behavior is called
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a>
and it's soooo useful if used properly.

<p>Functions are <em>first class objects</em> and I love this thing. They allow
you to write very expressive code which is one of my main goal as a programmer.

<h2>objects</h2>
<p>Objects in JavaScript are containers (collections) of key-value properties.
A key can be any string, a value any JavaScript value. They can contain other
objects so they can easily represent e.g. a tree or a graph.

<p>They can be easily initialized through object literals (which inspired the
JavaScript Object Notation aka <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format)
and easily updated.

<p>They provide a very powerful and flexible <em>associative array like</em>
data structure built-in the language.
