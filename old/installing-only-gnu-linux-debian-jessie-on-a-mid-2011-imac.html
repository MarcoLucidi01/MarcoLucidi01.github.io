<title>installing only GNU/Linux (Debian Jessie) on a mid 2011 iMac</title>

<h1>installing only GNU/Linux (Debian Jessie) on a mid 2011 iMac</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPbx6QH_p0s"><strong>boot process video</strong></a>

<p>The reasons why I have done this are various, but I think, the most
significant is that, after using a Linux distro daily on my laptop, go back on
OSX at home was painful and I felt like in "cage". This was not good for me, and
in fact, I preferred to use the laptop even at home and, I stopped to use that
iMac for a while.

<p>Then I realize that a full Linux installation on a mac can be done easily,
so, I did some research
(<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/320107/installing-only-linux-on-a-mac-and-in-case-go-back-to-macos">question Unix StackExchange</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IMac_Aluminum">Arch wiki</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/iMacIntel">Debian wiki</a>)
and on a Sunday morning I did it!

<p>I have this little guy here (<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp623?locale=en_US">iMac12,1</a>),
but with 8GB of ram which I personally installed.

<p>First of all, I made a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372">macOS installation media</a>,
so, if in future I want, I can reinstall it easily, since my intention was to
completely format the hard drive.

<p>Then I used a Debian 8 <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">netinstall</a>
through an USB drive, simply rebooted holding down "opt key" and selected the
right option. The installation was completed without issues using the Ethernet
cable (the WiFi has been also recognized by the installer).

<p>I installed KDE and at the first reboot I got only the shell! Unfortunately
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/firmware-linux-nonfree">firmware-linux-nonfree</a>
are required to get the Radeon work!

<h2>what worked out of the box and what did not</h2>

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li><strong style="color: green">Ethernet</strong>: since the installer;
<li><strong style="color: green">WiFi</strong>: I guess since the installer because it was recognized, but I can't say for sure;
<li><strong style="color: green">USB</strong>: nothing to say;
<li><strong style="color: green">Thunderbolt</strong>: tested with a second 1080p vga monitor that I use regularly (the only thing I can test);
<li><strong style="color: green">Speakers</strong>;
<li><strong style="color: green">FaceTime HD camera and microphone</strong>: tested with VLC;
<li><strong style="color: green">Suspend to RAM</strong>: all good;
<li><strong style="color: green">CD/DVD</strong>: tested with K3b;
</ul>

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li><strong style="color: orange">FireWire</strong>: can't test;
<li><strong style="color: orange">SD reader</strong>: can't test right now;
</ul>

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li><strong style="color: red">Video card</strong>: as I said, firmware-linux-nonfree are required;
<li><strong style="color: red">Jack audio</strong>: small issue, fix:
<pre>
# echo "options snd-hda-intel model=imac27_122" >> /etc/modprobe.d/imac_local.conf
</pre>
reboot. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=743936">Bugreport</a>;
<li><strong style="color: red">Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse</strong>:
fun fact, in the installer, I did the entire process with the Apple Wireless
Keyboard, but then, once Debian was up and running, it didn't work anymore. I
guess, bluetooth drivers are missing, but I won't install them since I hate that
things.
<li><strong style="color: red">Brightness</strong>: found a fix with xrandr:
<pre>
xrandr --output eDP --brightness 0.5
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Finally I started to use this machine again!
