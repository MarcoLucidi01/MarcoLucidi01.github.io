<h1>virtualbox guest additions on Debian</h1>

<p>Ok, this is a post for myself: every time that I need to install a new
Virtual Machine on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> I
systematically forget the steps to install the Guest Additions!

<p>Most of times, I install Debian, so this "tutorial" will be focused on this
particular Linux distribution.

<p>Open a terminal:
<pre>
# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
# apt-get install dkms
</pre>

<p>Now from the <strong>Devices</strong> menu, click on "Insert Guest Additions CD image..."

<p>If the .iso will not mount automatically, in a terminal:
<pre>
# mount /media/cdrom
</pre>

<p>then:
<pre>
# sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
# reboot
</pre>

<p>info: <a href="https://packages.debian.org/en/stable/dkms">dkms</a>

<p>from Virtualbox site: "Be sure to install DKMS before installing the Linux
Guest Additions. If DKMS is not available or not installed, the guest kernel
modules will need to be recreated manually whenever the guest kernel is updated"

<p>Actually these three packages are what we need for the Guest Additions:
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/en/stable/make">make</a>,
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/en/stable/gcc">gcc</a>,
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelHeaders">linux-headers</a>,
but are included in dependencies of dkms so they are installed automatically with dkms.

<p>P.S. it's recommended to install dkms even in the host system.

<p>If the installation failed, make sure that you have the last .iso available
and also the last version of Virtualbox:
