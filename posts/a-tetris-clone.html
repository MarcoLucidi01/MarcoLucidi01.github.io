<title>a tetris clone</title>
<p>2017-07-27</p>
<h1>a tetris clone</h1>
<p>this is my first &quot;&quot;&quot;big&quot;&quot;&quot; project in C, made after reading the bible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">K&amp;R
Second Edition</a> and after taking the Harvard course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a>.</p>
<p>actually I consider this as my &quot;final project&quot; for CS50: I enjoy C so much that
I had to choose it as the main tool for the project.</p>
<p>here a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRttr5_LnvI">demo video</a> and here the <a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone"><strong>source code</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>why tetris?</h2>
<p>well, first because I like it: I used to play <strong>A LOT</strong> when I was a kid on a
&quot;chinese fake GameBoy&quot; I had and more recently on my smartphone. and then
because I wanted to do something simple within my reach, but at the same time a
bit challenging, considering the language I chose.</p>
<p>also it is often considered as an &quot;Hello, World!&quot; to game development so once in
my life I had to do it.</p>
<h2>the game</h2>
<p>I tried to stick with the classic <em>Tetris</em>, so no &quot;wall kick&quot;, no &quot;hold piece&quot;,
no &quot;ghost piece&quot;, but I applied some &quot;new&quot; features that I like: &quot;soft drop&quot;
(without adding points) and this <a href="http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Random_Generator">random generator</a> so that I don't have to
swear to get an <em>I</em>.</p>
<p>keys to control what's on the screen are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEFT / DOWN / UP / RIGHT</strong> performs classical movements;</li>
<li><strong>H / J / K / L</strong> also performs classical movements. did you recognize them?
they are those of <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>! I'm a vim addicted and I thought it would be
nice if I could use vim keys to play Tetris =).</li>
<li><strong>SPACE</strong> performs &quot;hard drop&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> pause or unpause the game.</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> ends the game when it is paused.</li>
<li><strong>N</strong> starts a new game when the previous is over.</li>
<li><strong>Q</strong> close the program when the game is over.</li>
</ul>
<p>after the end of each game, it saves the level, score and lines along with the
current date and the time spent playing (including pause time) in a text file
called &quot;scores.txt&quot; within the folder in which the executable resides.</p>
<p>for now, there isn't a way to add a nickname (because you know, probably I will
be the only player...).</p>
<h2>the program</h2>
<p>if you haven't notice yet, I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> library.</p>
<p>two &quot;design choices&quot; I made (I know I probably screw up somewhere) were: write
&quot;reusable&quot; code (in part) and split different things in different files.</p>
<p>here the files tree and a bit of explanation:</p>
<pre><code>project/
        Makefile
        include/
                actions.h
                colors.h
                controller.h
                drawer.h
                game.h
                grid.h
                helpers.h
                tetramino.h
        src/
                controller.c
                drawer.c
                game.c
                grid.c
                helpers.c
                main.c
                tetramino.c
</code></pre>
<p>for the first time in my three months adventure with C, I felt the need to use a
<a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/Makefile"><code>Makefile</code></a> and it turned out to be veeery useful of course.</p>
<p>in <a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/helpers.c"><code>helpers.c</code></a> there are some helpers functions (youdontsay.jpg). there is
for example a &quot;<code>malloc</code> wrapper&quot; who calls <code>exit(EXIT_FAILURE)</code> if it was not
possible allocate memory. I call it (the wrapper) every time I need memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/grid.c"><code>grid.c</code></a> contains functions to handle guess what? right, the game grid on
which put blocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/include/actions.h"><code>actions.h</code></a> contains an enum of &quot;actions&quot; i.e. commands that modify the
current state of the game. I think their names are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>the &quot;magic&quot; happens in the files <a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/main.c"><code>main.c</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/game.c"><code>game.c</code></a>: they handle
the game flow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/tetramino.c"><code>tetramino.c</code></a> defines all you need to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino"><code>tetramino</code></a>, rotate
or change its shape and blindly put / remove it on / from a grid if it is not
locked.</p>
<p>with <a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/controller.c"><code>controller.c</code></a> instead, you can perform &quot;actions&quot; on a tetramino only
if that action is allowed, depending on the current state of the grid.</p>
<p>that is, to move, rotate or drop a piece, <code>game.c</code> relies on the functions in
<code>controller.c</code> who relies on the &quot;raw&quot; functions in <code>tetramino.c</code> after some
tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone/blob/master/src/drawer.c"><code>drawer.c</code></a> takes care of the &quot;ncurses part&quot; drawing the grid, the edges
and some informations. it has a function, <code>refresh_scene()</code>, which is called in
<code>game.c</code> to update what is on the screen when it's time to do so.</p>
<p><code>grid.c</code> and even <code>drawer.c</code> could be easily reused in other projects, e.g. in a
snake clone, tic-tac-toe, ..., basically anything who requires a simple grid,
because I made them &quot;not Tetris specific&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried to keep things as simple as possible (I always try to do this). for
example, I hard coded all possible rotations for each piece in <code>tetramino.c</code>
since in total they are only <em>4 x 7 = 28</em>. in this way I don't have to call a
function to rotate a matrix and sometimes rotate it backwards, but my functions
simply increment or decrement an index in range <em>[0,3]</em>. of course I did this
because the amount of memory used is very low.</p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>at the end of the day, the main goals of this project were:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn something new;</li>
<li>get a &quot;working&quot; Tetris clone;</li>
<li>get my feet wet with ncurses;</li>
<li>have some fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>and I guess I've achieved them all. even if it was not a big deal, it was my
first time with many things: a multiple files program (in C), a Makefile,
ncurses and small &quot;tricks&quot; I used in the code.</p>
<p>so it was worth it!</p>
