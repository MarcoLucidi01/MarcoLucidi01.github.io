<title>installing only gnu/linux (debian jessie) on a mid 2011 imac</title>
<p>2016-12-03</p>
<h1>installing only gnu/linux (debian jessie) on a mid 2011 imac</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPbx6QH_p0s"><strong>boot process video</strong></a></p>
<p>the reasons why I have done this are various, but I think, the most significant
is that, after using a linux distro daily on my laptop, going back on osx at
home was painful and I felt like in a &quot;cage&quot;. this was not good for me, and in
fact, I preferred to use the laptop even at home and, I stopped to use that imac
for a while.</p>
<p>then I realize that a full linux installation on a mac can be done easily, so, I
did some research (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/320107/installing-only-linux-on-a-mac-and-in-case-go-back-to-macos">question unix stackExchange</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IMac_Aluminum">arch wiki</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/iMacIntel">debian
wiki</a>) and on a sunday morning I did it!</p>
<p>I have this little guy here (<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp623?locale=en_US">imac12,1</a>), but with 8gb of ram which I
personally installed.</p>
<p>first of all, I made a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372">macos installation media</a>, so, if in future I want, I
can reinstall it easily, since my intention was to completely format the hard
disk.</p>
<p>then I used a debian 8 <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">netinstall</a> through an usb drive, simply rebooted
holding down &quot;opt key&quot; and selected the right option. the installation was
completed without issues using the ethernet cable (the wifi has been also
recognized by the installer).</p>
<p>I installed kde and at the first reboot I got only the shell! unfortunately
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/firmware-linux-nonfree">firmware-linux-nonfree</a> are required to get the radeon work!</p>
<h2>what did work out of the box</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ethernet</strong>: since the installer;</li>
<li><strong>wifi</strong>: I guess since the installer because it was recognized, but I can't
say for sure;</li>
<li><strong>usb</strong>: nothing to say;</li>
<li><strong>thunderbolt</strong>: tested with a second 1080p vga monitor that I use regularly
(the only thing I can test);</li>
<li><strong>speakers</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>camera and microphone</strong>: tested with vlc;</li>
<li><strong>suspend to ram</strong>: all good;</li>
<li><strong>cd/dvd</strong>: tested with k3b;</li>
</ul>
<h2>what did NOT work out of the box</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>video card</strong>: as I said, firmware-linux-nonfree are required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>jack audio</strong>: small issue, fix:</p>
<pre><code># echo &quot;options snd-hda-intel model=imac27_122&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/modprobe.d/imac\_local.conf
</code></pre>
<p>reboot. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=743936">Bugreport</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>apple wireless keyboard and magic mouse</strong>: fun fact, in the installer, I
did the entire process with the apple wireless keyboard, but then, once
debian was up and running, it didn't work anymore. I guess, bluetooth
drivers are missing, but I won't install them since I hate that things;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>brightness</strong>: found a fix with xrandr:</p>
<pre><code>xrandr --output eDP --brightness 0.5
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't test the <strong>firewire port</strong> nor the <strong>sd reader</strong>.</p>
<p>finally I started to use this machine again!</p>
