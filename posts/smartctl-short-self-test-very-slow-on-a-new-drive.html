<title>smartctl short self test very slow on a new drive</title>
<p>2021-06-20</p>
<h1>smartctl short self test very slow on a new drive</h1>
<p>I recently bought a new 4TB hard drive for my (homemade) nas and started setting
it up. I created a partition table with a single partition and an <code>ext4</code>
filesystem. I then <code>mount</code>ed the partition, but before starting <code>rsync</code>ing my
data, I wanted to do a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#Self-tests">S.M.A.R.T. testing</a>. the drive only supports
<em>short</em> and <em>long</em> self tests, no <em>conveyance</em>. I went for the short one since
I'm not very paranoid and I already have <code>smartd</code> setup to run tests weekly on
all the nas's disks.</p>
<p><code>smartctl</code> was so kind to tell me that the test will be completed in 2 minutes:</p>
<pre><code>Testing has begun.
Please wait 2 minutes for test to complete.
Test will complete after Fri Jun 18 18:34:03 2021 CEST
Use smartctl -X to abort test.
</code></pre>
<p>I listened to a song while waiting. 5 minutes goes by, song is over, let me
check:</p>
<pre><code>Self-test execution status:      ( 241) Self-test routine in progress...
                                        10% of test remaining.
</code></pre>
<p>ok, 10% remaining, we are almost there. let's wait. and 10 minutes goes by,
still 10% remaining. 20 minutes, still 10% remaining. 25 minutes, still 10%. it
seems to be stuck! it should have completed in 2 minutes, but half an hour has
passed and it still hasn't finished.</p>
<p>I was ninety percent sure that I ran the short test, not the long one. I aborted
the test with <code>smartctl -X</code> and this ugly line got into the self test log:</p>
<pre><code>Num  Test_Description    Status                  Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
...
# 9  Short offline       Aborted by host               10%         0         -
</code></pre>
<p>which confirmed that it was indeed a <em>short</em> test.</p>
<p>why was it taking so long? faulty disk?</p>
<p>I ran the short test again hoping this time it would finish in a reasonable
amount of time. same story, stuck at 10% remaining after more than 20 minutes. I
then decided to use one of the old tricks that <em>always</em> works with technology: I
rebooted the machine... boom, another nasty line in the log:</p>
<pre><code># 8  Short offline       Interrupted (host reset)      10%         1         -
</code></pre>
<p>I started the test again. meanwhile my <em>google-fu</em> wasn't helping much, everyone
talked about <strong>long</strong> tests being slow, 30+ hours on old disks that were about
to fail. my disk is new, all the smart attributes are perfect. then I read
somewhere that if the disk is doing a lot of I/O i.e.  is being used, the tests
may take longer. ok, makes sense, but there is no data on my disk and no service
is using it yet.</p>
<p>I felt a bit discouraged, maybe I had to return this drive and wait for another
one to arrive etc...</p>
<p>as a last resort, I tried to <code>umount</code> the partition thinking that somehow it
could help. <strong>10 seconds later the test completed without errors</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># 7  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         2         -
</code></pre>
<p>woow! coincidence? at least the disk seems to be good. I immediately started
another short test and completed without errors in 2 minutes!</p>
<pre><code># 6  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         2         -
</code></pre>
<p>ok, tests takes long <strong>only</strong> when it's mounted. strange because <em>nobody</em> is
using the disk (or at least that's what I believed). I thought: &quot;maybe I did
something wrong when I partitioned the disk&quot; and I repartitioned it again,
<code>mount</code>ed again aaand test stuck at 10% remaining.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do, I wasn't quite sure that the disk was OK and that it
was <em>safe</em> to put data on it. I fired up <code>top</code>** and stared at it for a while
thinking, like when you open the hood of a car trying to figure out what's
wrong. now with cars, that never helped me because I know nothing about cars,
but with computers sometimes it does help. I noticed this process that kept
popping up: <code>ext4lazyinit</code>. mmmm never heard of it, but the name was suspicious.
I found <a href="https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Ext4_Filesystem#Lazy_Initialization">this beautiful page</a> which talks about lazy initialization in <code>ext4</code>
filesystems (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When creating an Ext4 file system, the existing regions of the inode tables
must be cleaned (overwritten with nulls, or &quot;zeroed&quot;). The &quot;lazyinit&quot; feature
should significantly accelerate the creation of a file system, because it does
not immediately initialize all inode tables, initializing them gradually
instead during the initial mounting process in background
...
<strong>The &quot;ext4lazyinit&quot; kernel process writes at up to 16,000kB/s to the device
and thereby uses a great deal of the hard disk’s bandwidth</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>aaaha so maybe this is the process that is keeping my disk busy and it's slowing
down short self tests! to prove this theory I recreated the filesystem <em>again</em>
using these extended options:</p>
<pre><code># mkfs.ext4 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0 /dev/sda1
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>By specifying these options, the inodes and the journal will be initialized
immediately during creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>filesystem creation took quite a while this time, but in the end, no more
<code>ext4lazyinit</code> process and short smart self test completed in about 2 minutes
even with the partition mounted:</p>
<pre><code># 3  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         3         -
# 4  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         3         -
# 5  Short offline       Completed without error       00%         3         -
</code></pre>
<p>another solution was probably to <em>just wait</em> and eventually short tests would
complete rather fast once the disk was no more busy. at least, my &quot;impatience&quot;
let me figure out what was really happening and learn new things which is always
good!</p>
